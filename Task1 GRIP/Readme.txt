Data is continious in the dataset provided and not discrete(Boolean),Hence linear regression would be the suitable ML model(Supervised ML).
These two variable provided are co-related to each other.

Independent variable=Student study hours
Dependent variable=Percentage score
In above case study slope of the line is positive in nature.
Here dependent variable (study hrs) is directly proportional to the percentage scored.As no of study hrs increses,percentage of student also increases.Hence slope of LR line is positive
E.g In example where,if petrol price increases, avg of vehicle decreses in this type of scenario where independent variable value is indirectly proportional to the dependent variable slope of line is negative in nature
Equation of slope of line:y=mx+c
so in order to predict Y (Percentage_score) given X (study hrs), we need to know the values of m and c
(the modelâ€™s coefficients).

In training phase, aim is to learn slope and y-intercept of regression line. so that your cost between actulal student per and predicted student per is minimum.
